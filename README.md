# Question: How do you find the median of two sorted arrays? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to the problem of finding the median of two sorted arrays. The function `findMedianSortedArrays` takes two sorted arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`) as arguments. It first merges these two arrays into one using the `concat` method, and then sorts the resulting array in ascending order using the `sort` method. The function then determines the length of the sorted array. If the length is even, it calculates the median by averaging the two middle numbers in the array. This is done by adding the numbers at the indices `(len / 2 - 1)` and `(len / 2)`, and then dividing the result by 2. If the length is odd, it calculates the median by returning the number at the middle index, which is found using `Math.floor(len / 2)`. The function is tested with two sets of input arrays, and the results are logged to the console using `console.log`.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version, but with the addition of static typing. This is a feature of TypeScript that allows you to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and function return values. This can help catch errors at compile time, rather than at runtime.

In the TypeScript version, the function `findMedianSortedArrays` is declared with two parameters, `nums1` and `nums2`, both of which are arrays of numbers (`number[]`). The function is also declared to return a number (`number`). This means that if you try to pass anything other than an array of numbers to the function, or if you try to return anything other than a number, the TypeScript compiler will throw an error.

The TypeScript version also uses the spread operator (`...`) to concatenate the two arrays, whereas the JavaScript version uses the `concat` method. The spread operator is a more modern feature of JavaScript that is also supported in TypeScript.

The logic of the TypeScript solution is the same as the JavaScript solution. It merges the two arrays, sorts the merged array, and then returns the median value based on whether the length of the array is even or odd.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution follows the same logic as the JavaScript version. It first merges the two input arrays, sorts the resulting array in ascending order, and then checks if the length of the sorted array is even or odd. If it's even, it returns the average of the two middle numbers. If it's odd, it returns the middle number.

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used:

1. Array Representation: In JavaScript, arrays are used directly, while in C++, `std::vector` is used to represent an array. 

2. Merging Arrays: In JavaScript, the `concat()` method is used to merge two arrays. In C++, the `insert()` method of `std::vector` is used to merge two vectors.

3. Sorting: In JavaScript, the `sort()` method is used to sort an array. In C++, the `std::sort()` function from the `<algorithm>` library is used to sort a vector.

4. Output: In JavaScript, `console.log()` is used to print the output to the console. In C++, `std::cout` is used to print the output to the console.

5. Type Conversion: In JavaScript, the division operation automatically converts the result to a floating-point number if necessary. In C++, explicit conversion to double is needed when calculating the average of two integers to ensure a floating-point result.

6. Main Function: In C++, the `main()` function is required as the entry point of the program. In JavaScript, there is no such requirement.
